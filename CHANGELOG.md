*Merged to master on 2020-02-23*

This is the first functional version of AReSSO.

and get an observable version of the store that updates when the store changes.

### ADDED

- Add `Store`
- Add `IAction`
- Add tests for `Store`
- Add a few example state objects with documentation.
- Add `PropertyChange` utility to make writing `Copy` methods easier.
